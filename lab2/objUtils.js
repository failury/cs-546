// This method will take in an array of objects and a function, and will return one object. You must check that each value is a number type. You will evaluate the function on the values of the object, if multiple objects have the same key, you will add that value to the current value. The return object will not have any duplicated keys. 
function computeObjects([objects], func){

}
// This method will return a new object with key-value pairs that exist in both objects. Objects as values are valid. If no common keys are found, return an empty object.
function commonKeys(obs1, obj2){

}
// Given an object, you will return a new object where the values are now the keys and the keys are now the value. If a value has a type of array, for each element, you will have the element as the key and the value will be the original key. If a value has an object, you will flip those keys and values as well, but keep the key as the same.
