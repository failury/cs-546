    <h1>The death of Garth Superhalk</h1>

            I looked at the minuscule book in his hands and felt anxious. And walked over to the window and reflected on
            his creepy surroundings. I had always hated industrial with its hungry, hurt houes. It was a place that
            encouraged his tendency to feel anxious. Then I saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the
            figure of Garth Superhalk. Garth was a thoughtful muppet with wobbly elbows and curvaceous warts. As I
            stepped outside and Garth came closer, I could see the unrealistic glint in his eye.

            "I am here because I want Internet access," Garth bellowed, in a hilarious tone. He slammed his fist against my chest, with the force of 7653 donkeys. "I frigging love you, I." I looked back, even more stable and still fingering the minuscule book. "Garth, I just don't need you in my life any more.‚ÄùWe looked at each other with sad feelings, like two tired, tough tortoises sleeping at a very wild
            engagement party, which had piano music playing in the background and two considerate uncles chatting to the beat.

            Suddenly, Garth lunged forward and tried to punch me in the face. Quickly, I grabbed the minuscule book and brought it down on his skull. Garth's wobbly elbows trembled and his curvaceous warts wobbled. He looked shocked, his body raw like a poised, plain piano. Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later he was dead. I went back inside and made myself a nice glass of port.
